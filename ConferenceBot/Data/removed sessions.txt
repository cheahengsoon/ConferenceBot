          "abstract": "Are you responsible for more than just AppSec? What do you do when you have more teams to support than security experts? How can you make security champions out of dissenters in the development team?\n\nThere just aren’t enough security experts to go around. You have to support the multitude of Agile and DevOps teams that are making production software changes anywhere from once a month to several times a day? The lack of resources coupled with the ever increasing responsibilities can make you feel like a rouge warrior in the battle against cybercrime. What’s a security professional to do? Whether you are a team of one or five, there aren’t enough hours in the day and even if there was more budget, good luck finding someone to fill that security role. What if I told you that through careful selection and good training it is possible to build your own army from the very people who own the development process?\n\nWhat you will learn: \n\n1. Who to recruit as security champions \n\n2. How to train these champions in productive application security \n\n3. How to measure success \n\n4. How to build a scalable security program \n\n5. What to expect from champions (responsibilities)",

All the bad; all the good; the cutting edge and the tools, tips and tricks learned along the way that will help you in designing great natural interactive usability into your own software. \n\nTechnology has evolved to the point that the software and systems which have become necessary parts of our daily lives need to know more about us in order to help us in smarter ways. The environment that encapsulates the digital experience is just as important as the software. The entirety is the experience. The user shouldn’t feel the technology in the experience. Emerging Experiences should extend real world metaphors into software so that it blends together seamlessly. Emerging Experiences demand good Interaction Design.\n\nThis demo focused session will take an impressive look at some of the best software being built today and into the immediate future that leverages the Emerging Experiences.",
