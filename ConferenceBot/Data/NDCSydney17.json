We will review LTTNG and how it's used by .NET Core as a replacement for Windows ETW events, and see how to collect LTTNG traces efficiently and extract useful insights from them. We will also talk about core dumps, how to generate them on Linux, and how to get .NET-specific information out of a core dump using lldb and SOS.

When we got involved, the server needed daily resuscitation and fire fighting, and the team responsible spent the majority of their time trying to keep the system running instead of on-boarding new teams.

But why would you use React Native? How run-time typed language like JavaScript be a better choice for developing apps than say, Swift, Java, Kotlin, C# ( Xamarin ) or C++ all compile time static type checked languages. Firstly is just that, there is no need for a compile step, React Native can update the JS without having to reload compile and replace the previous application. Compiling an app everytime can take a long time for a small project this might be 1-5min, but larger apps can easily take as long as 45 minutes or more to build a single app. ",
            "In this talk, we will explore how features like hot code reloading allow for much faster edit and run cycles, how you can use tools like Flow or TypeScript to add type safety without incurring the long compile times found in more native methods. To Prove the how simple and fast React Native is to builds apps we will create a simple app live on stage. To top it all off, you can even embed React into existing Native Apps, avoiding the need for a total rewrite."

There are areas however where REST can deliver less than ideal client experiences. Often many HTTP requests are required to render a single view.",

GraphQL is a query language that provides a clean and simple syntax for consumers to interrogate your APIs. These queries are strongly types, hierarchical and enable clients to retrieve only the data they need.",

It allows you to write one UI that is shared between platforms using the underlying UI controls native to each OS. The downside to this is the lowest-common-denominator model - only the features that are available on all platforms are provided out of the box. Luckily Xamarin provides a swathe of techniques to allow you to add platform specific tweaks.",

Each technique will be demonstrated with a live coded example showing just how easy they are to get working.",

Immutable algebraic data types are an invaluable tool for proper problem modeling, because they focus on keeping illegal states from being representable.

We will dive into how ADTs can be represented, implemented with native C# constructs, and used with pattern matching and partial modification. We’ll conclude with the mechanics of parsing and code generation, look at an open source library and tool, and discuss practical integration of FP patterns into daily work in C#.",
